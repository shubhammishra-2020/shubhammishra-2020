## Welcome to my GitHub Page!
I am a Junior at San Jose State majoring in Computer Engineering. I am interested in bringing my skills, experience, and ideas to an Embedded Software Engineering role. 

### Current Projects

<i>Spartan Racing </i> <br>
* <i>**VCU GUI**</i> - Designing a tool that gathers **CAN** IDs  from the devices connected to the Vehicle Control Unit (VCU) and displays in a readable format the car's performance as it went around the track. Currently, our configuration can track the Battery Module States, Brake Pressure, and Throttle Position. By the end of the season, we will be able to manipulate CAN IDs to provide subsytems with debugging abilities such as forcing High Voltage, limiting Engine Speed, etcetera. Future iterations will make VCU level changes, enabling us to flash changes without making changes in the firmware which can pose a major risk to people unfamiliar with it.
* <i>**Dashboard**</i> - Designing a dashbord user interface that can be intuitive to the driver. Using the CAN IDs on the car, we are programming LEDs to show in real time the RPM, battery state, and any safety faults. In addition, we are developing an interface which will allow the driver to manipulate parts of the car within the software to the driver's liking. 

<i> California Department of Insurance </i>
* <i>**Asset Inventory**</i> - Gathering data of the Information Technology assets to reduce cost in buying redundant equipment and tracks out of date equipment that can increase the exposure of the department's data. Creating an internal SharePoint site to display the inventory and designing procedures that enables members of the department to easily make changes or updates that can be useful to other staff members.
